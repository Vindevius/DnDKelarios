Why do you not get involved?
	Long ago, I put limits to my powers so I could not take away the agency and free will of anyone. I was once a man. I stumbled upon a source of endless power and created a world far away from here where people could be free to make their dreams a reality. One evil man took a portion of that power, and became a tyrant over those people for a millennia. I lost the love of my life in the aftermath. This was before I took on the full power that I have now.
	One day, a mere boy came into that world and brought hope with him. Once that tyrant was overthrown, I took the power of that well into myself, and with it I created my children. After that, I put limits to my power as to not become like that tyrant before. I cannot interfere because I have taken that ability away.
