### The Grand Abyss

- Lvl: 14

Leysa visited Verithinus' temple and asked for advice. Verithinus appeared to her and answered the following questions:
	- What will my daughter be like and what will she be destined for?
		- Why would I spoil that? Your daughters will be a joy in your life, but as with all children, they will bring you some sorrow along the way.
	- Who is going to replace the three vile ones?
		- Why would I spoil that surprise?
	- Anything to help moving forward?
		- Be careful. Especially since you carry something so precious. Be watchful. 
	- How can I be a better ruler for my people?
		- Be just, but loving. Never be cruel, but be firm. It is a challenge that you will learn as you go.
	- Why do you not get involved?
		- Long ago, I put limits to my powers so I could not take away the agency and free will of anyone. I was once a man. I stumbled upon a source of endless power and created a world far away from here where people could be free to make their dreams a reality. One evil man took a portion of that power, and became a tyrant over those people for a millennia. I lost the love of my life in the aftermath. This was before I took on the full power that I have now.
		- One day, a mere boy came into that world and brought hope with him. Once that tyrant was overthrown, I took the power of that well into myself, and with it I created my children. After that, I put limits to my power as to not become like that tyrant before. I cannot interfere because I have taken that ability away.
	- What are your plans after everything goes down?
		- The gods will leave the material plane. I will place a barrier so none of them can directly interact with Kelarios. We will watch from afar. No longer will you have to worry about rogue deities.
	- Why did you choose to reveal yourself to Diana first, when she didn’t believe in you?
		- That is precisely why I did. You are already faithful and believing. Diana tends to have to see things first. Each child is unique and requires a different approach. You did not need to see me to follow me. Diana did.
	- How can I be the best mother to my daughter?
		- I believe you are too concerned about your own capabilities. The advice I will give you is to listen to your children.
	- Is Helios in Hell?
		- Helios is locked away. A prisoner in Carceri. So, yes. He is in Hell.
	- Why did Leysa's parents love Helios more than her?
		- Sweet child, where did you get that idea? Your parents were imperfect, but they loved you immensely. In their old age, Helios manipulated them in his desire for the throne and power. That was his undoing.
	- Was it hard to banish the Vile Ones because you still love them?
		- Yes. Even now, sending you to rip their souls apart with those soul spikes, breaks my heart. Although it is necessary, it does not make it easy.
	- If I could go back, is there anything I could’ve changed?
		- Of course there is, but you do not have that luxury. Nor do I.
	- Are my loved ones at peace?
		- Yes. Your parents are at peace in Elysium.
	- Is there anything I need to stop doing?
		- Stop doubting yourself. There are good things to come in the future.
	- How do I help Diana?
		- Watch her. Keep those she loves safe to the best of your ability.

After Leysa's meeting with Verithinus, and the others' shenanigans, the party went to the Abyss to acquire Marcaith's essence. There, they descended into the Grand Abyss. Diana arrived on her mount Azura before the others. She was confronted by some quasits (the demon form of imps). The others arrived shortly after where they encounter Balor, who was once a shadow demon, now a full-blown Balor demon. As they battled him, a necromancer, a blackguard, and several Marcaith cultists ambushed them. Garic was among these cultists.

The party defeated Balor, shortly after killing most of the cultists. By a stroke of luck, Diana banished Garic for a minute, giving the party enough time to dispatch the remaining cultists, acquire the poison seeping from the walls, which is Marcaith's essence, and surround the place Garic disappeared. As soon as Garic reappeared, the wrath of the party descended on him, killing him instantly.

The party returned to Kelar shortly after.

They were also able to kill Garic, the champion of Marcaith.
