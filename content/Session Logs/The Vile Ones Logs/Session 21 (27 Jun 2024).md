### Defense of Kelar

- Lvl: 20

After defeating Marcaith, the party remained in the city to straighten a few things out over the course of a few days. As soon as they were finished, the party made their way to Kelar to prepare to face Domexius and King Astrolites Harlor.

The party, with Lydia and Aladus disguised as a noble, met with the Council of the Stars, the ruling body of Kyria. The council, led by Nexus Sparrow, a warforged, asked for the party's opinion on the ensuing battle. At this time, the armies of Veteria were sieging the city of Kelar. The Santamaria, the sister ship of the Avenger, just barely managed to enter the bay of Kelar before the bay too was blocked off by Veteria.

The Council of the Stars revealed there was an item in the vault that Astrolites and Domexius wanted to get their hands on that would be very dangerous. After much debate, it was decided to move the legendary item known as the ruinstone out of the city. Diana revealed to the council that she had previously destroyed the ruinstone the night she eloped with Derek.

The council wasn't sure how to respond to this news, as they were debating destroying the ruinstone anyway. The council decided to deal with the consequences of Diana's actions, which did result in the death of many guards, a mage, and a couple of Kelar's most valiant champions, after the current threat was over. Edladon, a half-elf member of the council, sealed the fake ruinstone that Diana had left behind, and the party was tasked with accidentally giving the fake to Astrolites once he appeared.

The party spent the rest of the day preparing for the coming battle. Orion helped set up the spells Hallow and Forbiddance so that no one could teleport into the immediate area, and those that entered must make a save or be vulnerable to radiant damage.

The next day, in the mist-shadowed area between the Council of the Stars and the Cloudkey Grove, the party walked into the darkness. The party consisted of Diana, Leysa, Comrad, Orion, Derek, Aladus, Lydia, Thor, and Charadraak with a few guards and knights outside. Archers, Kelar champions, as well as Zanryn, and Draynnon remain inside.

As they left the Council of the Stars, the wings of a dragon were heard through the mist. A burst of fire cleared away a small portion of the mist near the front of the Council of the Stars. King Astrolites Harlor descended on an ancient red dragon. The dragon landed, allowing King Astrolites, a leonin gladiator known as Heth, four gladiators, and two red drakes to disembark from the ancient dragon. Charadraak Quipclaw stood nearby in his ancient copper dragon form.

One of the gladiators tossed Comrad's severed wings between Astrolites and the party. Astrolites asked if Comrad missed his wings.

King Astrolites saw the box containing the fake ruinstone, which Diana held, and demanded it. Diana denied him. King Astrolites told the party that he would wait for his master to arrive. Shortly after King Astrolites said that, the party could hear the wings of a great dragon. The three champions in the party could feel how close Domexius was to them.

Before the party was able to choose a course of action, a blaze of fire split the sky, casting its heat down to them. The flames evaporated the nearby mist, revealing most of the Cloudkey Grove and the Council of the Stars. The sun shown brightly above, but a massive shadow blocked it. Domexius rose high above Kelar, watching the party down below.

Domexius landed roughly on the Council of the Stars, leaning on the two forward towers. Glass shattered as the building's skylight broke. Domexius clutched the two towers as they buckled beneath his weight. Domexius commanded Astrolites to prove his worth by killing the party. Domexius also told Vadro the Voiceless, the ancient red dragon, to kill Charadraak as Domexius didn't care for his type of jester in his court.

Vadro soared into the sky after Charadraak who rose above the Cloudkey Grove where the two ancient dragons fought. Astrolites bowed to Domexius, and allowed the party to strike first. Diana turned invisible, dashing into the Cloudkey Grove, to convince Astrolites she has the real ruinstone. He took off after her as the rest of the party dispatched of the gladiators and the drakes.

Comrad finished off Heth, Astrolites highest gladiator. Domexius stole the box from Diana, breaking it open, which set the fake ruinstone off. The stone left a brief message in DIana's voice before blowing up directly in Astrolites' face. In a rage, Astrolites attacked Diana, who invoked duplicity to duplicate herself and then casted Maddening Darkness to mess with Astrolites' mind. Several wolves attacked Astrolites as well, which he turned into ash.

Diana prepared a cocktail, which incapacitated an injured Astrolites. Meanwhile, Comrad heard a summons from Sovenia to touch his wings, which he did. In a whirl of motion, Sovenia reattached and healed Comrad's wings, and Comrad flew toward the fallen Astrolites.

Astrolites roared in denial as a newly healed Comrad descended on him. Comrad struck him once, and then once more, this time with a Nat 20. "To the pain," Comrad said, as he cut off Astrolites' feet. Then he cut off his hands, then his nose, and then his tongue. Astrolites screamed in agony as Comrad cut out each of his eyes. Comrad then took Astrolites by the throat flying into the sky, and then Comrad decapitated Astrolites, allowing his body to fall to the charred ground below.

Domexius, remarking on how disappointing Astrolites was, told the party it was his turn. He then unleased a massive roaring cone of flames across all those before him, setting the Cloudkey Grove ablaze.

Domexius attacked the party with his full force. He noticed Lydia was a simulacrum, and attempted to dispel her, but was blocked by Aladus. This was a recurring theme, as Domexius also used his own counterspell multiple times throughout the fight.

Domexius knocked down one of the towers of the Council of the Stars, killing those within. Later, he knocked down the second tower, a similar fate to those in the last tower waiting for those inside. The Cloudkey Grove continued to burn as Domexius sent torrents of flame against the party, killing all the guards and knights outside the walls.

During the battle, the ancient red dragon fell to the ground next to the second fallen tower. Charadraak fell shortly after. Vadro the Voiceless was dead, and Charadraak was near death. Charadraak, now in his human form, fled into the building to recuperate, telling the party he was of no use to them in his current state.

Leysa shape changed into an ancient copper dragon as Comrad took to the skies. Orion healed the party as Diana teleported onto Domexius' back with the Noose of the Gods, which she used to tie his wings. Domexius struggled against the adamantine rope, further trapping himself within it.

Domexius' flames turned white hot, even burning the fire immune Leysa. Orion heals the party, including the wounded Charadraak inside. Domexius continues to burn those around them, including using a fireball spell. He attempted to cast Dominate Person on Leysa in her dragon form. When that failed, he tried to cast Suggestion on Leysa to do it, which also failed. He cast Power Word Stun on Comrad, paralyzing him for a brief moment.

Orion called on Aeontas for Divine Intervention, which Aeontas immediately answered. Orion began to glow, his eyes turning pure silver, as Aeontas empowered Orion and his spells, renewing Orion's hope.

After Comrad broke through the spell, Domexius targeted him and the newly empowered party cleric Orion, bringing both near death. Orion chose to heal Comrad instead of himself. At this moment, Charadraak stepped out from the relative safety of the Council of the Stars and pointed at Domexius, casting Wish.

A mass of energy hit Domexius with the full force of Charadraak's wrath, sending Domexius into his chromatic awakening. The spell also had the consequence of sapping all of Charadraak's strength, which left Charadraak helpless as Domexius, now flowing with elemental energy, charged directly at Charadraak. The party watched as Domexius engulfed Charadraak, swallowing Charadraak whole.
