### New Allies and Captured Friends

- Lvl: 15

As the party returns from the Abyss, a member of the Kyria Council of the Star, Kix Zodrak, a half-orc, along with a blue winged dragonborn, finds the party. Kix explains that the blue winged dragonborn is General Comrad, one of the ten generals of the Kyrian Army. Kix inquires of the party to allow General Comrad to join them on their adventures to stop the Vile Ones. The party accepts General Comrad into their midst.

The party, with their new member, descend back to Eradas' lair beneath the Cloudkey Grove and create the three soul spikes for Marcaith at the Void Forge. On their return from the Void Forge, Eradas becomes concerned and explains that those of their party that were left in the Cloudkey Grove have been ambushed. Without any hesitance, Eradas teleports them to outside the entrance of his lair. The party quickly evaluates the situation through the dense mists of Kelar. Aladus has been feebleminded, causing him to be led away without complaint by Marcaith's cultists. Gurgi lies nearly dead to one side, Thor trying to defend his body. Derek is nowhere to be seen.

The cultists of Marcaith are joined by an ancient black dragon. As the party reveals themselves, a tall and built man descends from the trees with steel spikes instead of eyes. He attacks them with two obsidian axes, allowing some of the cultists time to teleport away with the feebleminded Aladus, capturing him.

The ancient black dragon flies away, picking up the almost lifeless Gurgi as it leaves. The party is unable to stop them as an ancient red dragon, sent by Domexius, attacks the party. The party is able to defeat both the ancient red dragon and the steel inquistor, but were unable to save Aladus and Gurgi from capture.

After the battle, Diana finds an injured Derek just inside the cave entrance to Eradas' lair. Apparently, Derek was blasted by one of the cultists' spells, sending him back into the cave, which Eradas allowed him to enter.

Diana, maddened at the results of the ambush, runs off into the mist, venting her anger on to hapless strangers. Leysa, Orion, and Comrad make their way back to the Weary Pirate. Eventually, Diana rejoins them and they plan on how to save Aladus and Gurgi, who are on their way to Marcaith's fortress on the Thilcaith Plateau, where Marcaith himself is held trapped in the Negative Energy Plane.

That night, Diana and Derek went on a heist, which resulted in the destruction of a powerful item held in the most secure vault in Kyria, as well as the capture of a couple of legendary items and a painting of Verithinus. The couple met Lydia afterward, giving her one of the items known as the Luck Blade. Diana and Derek eloped that night due to recent events. Lydia was the one to marry them.
