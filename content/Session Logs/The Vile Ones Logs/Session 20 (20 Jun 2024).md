### Marcaith

- Lvl: 19

After defeating Morthadius, the party made their way to the city of Crassus in the Western City States to set up a trap for Marcaith. During the week and a half leading up to Marcaith's arrival in Crassus, the party set their trap in a crossroads in the Dock Ward of Crassus. The Shadows helped to clear the area of citizens to prevent as many civilian casualties as possible.

Near the end of the week, the Avenger arrived at the dock. Captain Zale moored the ship near the site of the trap. Lucky, now with his foot on his belt, helped Scarbest set up cannons around the district.

Leysa kept having nightmares of her family being taken as captives by Marcaith. This included Osian, Neomi, and Exandria.

Finally, the day of Marcaith's arrival came. The party waited as the three who are champions (Comrad, Diana, and Leysa) felt Marcaith's presence draw near. Diana placed a 3 foot ornamental sphere on the fountain in the middle of the crossroads.

Marcaith arrived shortly after. The party watched as Marcaith and an adult black dragon flew into the city from the west. Marcaith threw down two of the palace's towers, and stopped there for a long moment as if conversing with someone.

Marcaith then flew to the three temples in Crassus (Aeontas, Vecmetus, and Exsoria), toppling each one. As he flew to destroy the temple of Exsoria, the adult black dragon flew to where the party was and attacked them.

The party and those with them sprung into action. Charadraak shape changed into his ancient copper dragon form and attacked the adult black dragon. Together, the party killed the black dragon, using the Noose of the Gods to restrain her.

Meanwhile, Marcaith destroyed the bridge that crossed the river east of Crassus, along with many ships along the river. As the black dragon lay dying, Marcaith landed in the center of the square.

The battle with Marcaith was rough. He almost instantly killed Lucky with his first acid blast. It took a while for someone to get to him to revive him. With another acid blast, he killed the half-orcs Hel and Tulk on the Avenger, damaging the ship in the process.

The Punisher, a bounty hunter changeling cleric teleported into the square with three people dressed in cult robes. One of these cultists was shorter than the other two.

Orion didn't hesitate to cast spells toward the cultists, killing one of them. The three cultists didn't even try to dodge out of the way. Leysa, who was nearby, saw that under the hood of that cultist was the face of Neomi. The other two cultists were respectively Osian and Exandria. Leysa revivified Neomi and Comrad helped get them to the nearby inn, killing the Punisher along the way.

Marcaith turned invisible at one point, and then ate Orion. Orion pulled out his immovable rod and set it in Marcaith's stomach, escaping shortly after from Marcaith's stomach. Marcaith ripped the immovable rod out of his stomach and then ate Comrad. Comrad escaped by futher widening the hole left in Marcaith's stomach.

Shortly after, Diana and Comrad nailed the three soul spikes into Marcaith as Orion called for Aeontas' aid. Aeontas aided them by casting time stop on each of them. This enabled the party to bring Marcaith to the brink of his final death. During the time stop, Diana called for everyone with the buildings to retreat, which they did. Everyone but Diana went with them.

As the spell ended, Marcaith snarled down at Diana as Diana made one last snide comment to Marcaith before releasing and eldritch blast. This eldritch blast wasn't targeted at Marcaith. Instead, it hit the 3 foot ornamental sphere on the fountain. This sphere was a creation of Reggie and Scarbest's known as a NaK sphere. It was a giant explosive that is highly reactive to water.

As Diana blasted the NaK sphere into the fountain, she dimension doored out of the area. The party witnessed the explosion go off, blasting the god of affliction directly in the face. Marcaith, the vile one of pain, died in the aftermath, barely holding onto a few short seconds after the explosion destroyed all of the surrounding buildings.

As Marcaith died, a dark portal appeared. A sallow-skinned man in black and poison green robes stepped out. This man put his hand in the swirly power left of Marcaith, and took it into himself. This man was none other than the god Zehir (aka Set), and he ascended to take Marcaith's place on the pantheon.

In the aftermath of Marcaith's death, a few of the crew of the Avengers raided the palace in the Hill Top District, taking High Lord Cyrus hostage. Diana tortured Cyrus over the next couple of days.
